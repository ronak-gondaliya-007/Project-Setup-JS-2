# Project Name

## Overview
This is a Node.js-based application designed with scalability, modularity, and maintainability in mind. It follows professional coding standards and best practices to ensure clean and efficient code. This project structure is suitable for building robust APIs and backend systems for web or mobile applications.

---

## Features
- Configuration Management: Centralized configuration handling for seamless environment setup.
- Modular Architecture: Clear separation of concerns with a folder structure for controllers, services, models, routes, etc.
- Validation: Request validation using `Joi` or similar libraries.
- Middleware: Custom middleware for authentication, logging, error handling, and more.
- Database Integration: Supports popular ORMs like Sequelize and Mongoose for database management.
- Utilities: Reusable utility functions for common tasks.
- Logging: Integrated logging for error tracking and debugging.
- Testing: Unit and integration testing setup.
- Environment Handling: `.env` file support for managing sensitive credentials and environment variables.
- Documentation: Comprehensive inline comments and API versioning for clarity and maintainability.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16.x or later)
- NPM or Yarn
- A database (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository/project-name.git
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd project-name
   
3. Install dependencies:
   npm install
   
4. Set up the environment:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:
     cp .env.example .env
   - Update `.env` with your configuration values (e.g., database URL, API keys).

---

## Running the Application

1. Start the development server:
   npm run dev
   
2. Start the production server:
   npm start

---

## Scripts
- `npm run dev`: Starts the development server using `nodemon`.
- `npm start`: Starts the production server.
- `npm test`: Runs unit and integration tests.

---

## Folder Details

### `src/config/`
Contains configuration files for setting up the database, environment variables, and other project-level configurations.

### `src/controllers/`
Holds route handlers where API business logic is implemented.

### `src/middlewares/`
Includes middleware for tasks like authentication, logging, error handling, etc.

### `src/models/`
Contains database schema definitions (e.g., Sequelize or Mongoose models).

### `src/routes/`
Defines the API endpoints and connects them to the controllers.

### `src/services/`
Handles core business logic and reusable operations.

### `src/utils/`
Contains helper functions such as date formatting, logging utilities, etc.

### `src/validators/`
Includes schemas for validating incoming API requests.

---

## API Documentation
You can use tools like Swagger or Postman to document your APIs. Include details for endpoints, request/response formats, and error codes.

---

## Testing

1. Run unit tests:
   npm test
   
2. Ensure the test coverage meets the requirements.
